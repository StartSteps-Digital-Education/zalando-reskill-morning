Exercise 1.
Objective: Imagine you have a list of integer numbers. Your task is to filter out all even numbers from this list and create a new list containing only the odd numbers.
Expected Outcome: Given a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], your output should be [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
Bonus: Return the sum of the filtered odd numbers.

Exercise 2.
Objective: You are given a list of words in lowercase. Your challenge is to transform each word into its uppercase counterpart.
Expected Outcome: Given a list like ["hello", "world", "streams", "java"], the transformed list should be ["HELLO", "WORLD", "STREAMS", "JAVA"].
Bonus: Count the number of characters in the transformed list (excluding spaces).

Exercise 3.
Objective: You have a list of integers. Calculate the sum of all these integers.
Expected Outcome: Given a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the computed sum should be 15.
Bonus: Find the average of the list.

Exercise 4.
Objective: Join all strings from a given list into a single string. These words should be separated by commas in the resulting string.
Expected Outcome: From a list such as ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the resulting string should be "apple,banana,cherry".
Bonus: Reverse the order of the words in the resulting string. So, for the list ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the resulting string would be "cherry,banana,apple".

Exercise 5.
Objective: Given a list of words, count how many words have more than 3 characters.
Expected Outcome: For a list like ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "dolphin"], the count should be 2 since "elephant" and "dolphin" have more than 3 characters.
Bonus: Return the shortest word from the list.
