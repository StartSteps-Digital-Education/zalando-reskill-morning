Exercise 1:
Create a Java program using JDBC that performs multiple money transfers between multiple bank accounts within a single transaction.
Implement a rollback mechanism to ensure data consistency in case of an error during any part of the transaction.

To set up the database with tables and initial data, you can use the following SQL statements as an example:

-- Create a bank_accounts table
CREATE TABLE bank_accounts (
    account_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert initial account data
INSERT INTO bank_accounts (account_id, balance) VALUES
    (0, 1000.00),
    (0, 1500.00),
    (0, 800.00),
    (0, 2000.00);
