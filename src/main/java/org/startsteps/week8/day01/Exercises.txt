Exercise 1: Counting Words in a File
Create a Java program that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it.

Bonus: Extend the program to display the frequency of each word in the text.

Exercise 2: Reading User Input until 'Exit'
Create a program where users can keep entering strings into the console. The program should terminate when the user types 'Exit'.

Bonus: Store all the entered strings in an ArrayList and, upon exit, write all the strings to a file named "userInputs.txt".

Exercise 3: Appending to a File
Create a program that allows the user to add more content to an existing file without overwriting its previous content.

Bonus: Before appending, check if the content already exists in the file. If it does, notify the user instead of appending.

Exercise 4: Reading a Properties File
Create a program that reads key-value pairs from a .properties file and prints them to the console.

Bonus: Allow the user to search for a specific key and display its corresponding value, notifying the user if the key doesn't exist.

Exercise 5: Creating Directories
Create a program that allows users to specify a path, and the program should create a directory at that specified location.

Bonus: Allow the creation of nested directories based on user input, like "folder/subfolder/subsubfolder".
