Exercise: Animal Kingdom Serialization

Description:

You are to create a simple system that represents an animal kingdom. The system will have the following entities:

    Animal (Abstract Class)
        name (String)
        age (int)
        Abstract method: sound() (returns String)

    Mammal (Class extending Animal)
        Overrides sound() (e.g., returns "Mammal Sound!")

    Bird (Class extending Animal)
        Overrides sound() (e.g., returns "Bird Sound!")

    Zoo (Class)
        animals (List<Animal>)

    SerializableInterface (Interface)
        Method: void serialize(String filename)
        Method: void deserialize(String filename)

The Zoo class should implement the SerializableInterface. The serialization and deserialization methods will save and load the list of animals respectively.

Tasks:

    Define the abstract class Animal with its properties and abstract method.

    Define the classes Mammal and Bird extending the Animal class.

    Define the SerializableInterface with the mentioned methods.

    Define the Zoo class, implementing the SerializableInterface. Implement the serialization and deserialization methods using Java's ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream respectively.

    In the main class:
        Create a few instances of Mammal and Bird.
        Add them to a Zoo.
        Serialize the Zoo object to a file.
        Deserialize the Zoo object from the file.
        Display the names and sounds of the deserialized animals to ensure that they've been loaded correctly.

Bonus:
    Extend the Animal kingdom with more types of animals (e.g., Reptile, Fish).
    Implement error handling for file operations.
    Implement a search functionality in the Zoo class to search for an animal by name.
    Add a serialVersionUID to the Animal, Mammal, Bird, and Zoo classes. Hint: https://www.baeldung.com/java-serial-version-uid
